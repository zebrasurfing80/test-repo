# Code of conduct
 1. Don't be mean to other contributors unless you're also helpful or they're being <em>really</em> dumb.
 2. Trolling is allowed, but not in excess. Basically, if we would have to clean up after your mess, don't do it.
## If you have any issues:
Create an issue and assign thecakeisalie25, or if it <b>absolutely needs</b> to be private you can email `larsona@outlook.com`.
